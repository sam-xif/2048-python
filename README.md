# 2048 AI
Kumar Anupam, Sam Xifaras

Using Yangshun Tay and Emmanuel Goh's 2048 implementation as a base, we implemented
a number of AI agents with different algorithms to play the game.

## How to Run
Run `./run.py` to run the agent and watch it play a game.
By default, the program uses variable-depth expectimax, which was our top-performing
algorithm. Take a look inside `src/main.py` to tweak which agent the program uses.

## Contributing
